effective is an adjective that means achieving a result or intended purpose in an adequate or satisfactory way.

efficient is an adjective that means accomplishing a result in the best possible way while saving time and effort.

When it comes to using the words effective and efficient, you want to ensure you're expressing yourself in the most accurate way. What is the biggest difference between the two? If you're stating that a goal was met in an adequate way, you'd use the word "effective."

But, if you want to convey an accomplishment that also saved time, money and effort, you'd use "efficient." See below for a list of instances in which you would use these particular adjectives:

    Sally's method of mopping the kitchen floor proved to be effective.

    Using a pen and paper is an effective way to journal about your personal experiences.

    Because of his effective presentation, the stakeholders better understood how the process worked.
    
    
        Because of his efficient manner, he completed more than a day's work in just four hours.

    The waitress worked efficiently to ensure the diners received their food in a timely manner.

    Jerry's efficient study habits helped him memorize the reading material and leave early for the holiday break.

An important note here. When specifying a step always say where you need to do
it first and then say what you need to do. That is more logical. Notice in step

When to use commas

1.In a series consisting of three or more elements, separate each element with a comma .

Microsoft style

You need a hard disk, a VGA monitor, and a mouse .

Not Microsoft style

You need a hard disk, an EGA or VGA monitor and a mouse .

2.Use a comma following an introductory phrase .

Microsoft style

In Windows, you can run many programs .

Not Microsoft style

In Windows you can run many programs .

3.If you specify a full date in midsentence, use a comma on each side of the year .

Microsoft style

 The February 4, 2003, issue of the New York Times reported that . . . .

When not to use commas

1.Do not join independent clauses with a comma unless you include a conjunction . Online documentation often has space constraints, and it may be difficult to fit in the coordinate conjunction after the comma . In these instances, separate into two sentences or use a semicolon .

Microsoft style

Click Options, and then click Allow Fast Saves .

Click Options; then click Allow Fast Saves . (Only if space is limited .)

* Rule . In sentences where two independent clauses are joined by connectors such as and, or, but,etc., put a comma at the end of the first clause.

Incorrect: He walked all the way home and he shut the door.
Correct: He walked all the way home, and he shut the door.

Rule. When starting a sentence with a dependent clause, use a comma after it.

Example: If you are not sure about this, let me know now.

Rule. A comma is usually unnecessary when the sentence starts with an independent clause followed by a dependent clause.

Example: Let me know now if you are not sure about this.

Not Microsoft style

Click Options, then click Allow Fast Saves .

2.Do not use a comma between the verbs in a compound predicate .

Microsoft style

The Setup program evaluates your computer system and then copies the essential files to your hard disk .

The Setup program evaluates your computer system, and then it copies the essential files to your hard disk .

Not Microsoft style

The Setup program evaluates your computer system, and then copies the essential files to your hard disk .

3.Do not use commas in month-year formats .

Microsoft style

Microsoft introduced Windows 7 in October 2009 .

Not Microsoft style

Microsoft introduced Windows 7 in October, 2009 .

If the list does not contain full sentences, Chicago style does not put punctuation at the end of list items as a rule (please see 6.124), but it allows for semicolons if the list items are complex and contain commas. This means that in some documents, some complex vertical lists may feature semicolons at the ends of items and others, less complex, may have commas or no punctuation at all. Whether the presence of a single comma in a single list item would require the addition of semicolons to render the list readable is a matter of editorial judgment, and not something that CMOS is likely to legislate.

The main recommendations on the use of forms and tenses of verbs in technical writing:

    ﻿Do not use:


    Continuous Aspect ('ing' form of the verb unless it is part of a term, so it's not a verb there, it's a noun:  stealing a reference)
    Present, Past Perfect Continuous etc. (the Past Participle with a form of the verb HAVE)
    Passive Voice (the Past Participle of a verb with a helping verb to make a complex verb)

    Use:﻿


    the Infinitive (not -ING)
    the Imperative (Read the information below.)
    the Present Simple Tense
    the Past Simple Tense
    the Future Simple Tense
    the Active Voice as much as possible
    a Verb instead of a noun to describe an action where possible

Present perfect should be avoided in the sentences!!!
Always start the paragraph with the topic sentence!!!

Recommendations for sentences and paragraphs.

Sentences

    Keep to one topic per sentence.
    Do not omit words or use contractions to make your sentence shorter.
    Use a vertical list for complex texts.
    Use connecting words to join consecutive sentences that contain related thoughts.


Sentence length

    Keep sentences as short as possible (20 words maximum for procedural writing, 25 words maximum for descriptive writing).
    Write only one instruction per sentence.
    Write more than one instruction per sentence only when more than one action is done at the same time.
    In an instruction, write the verb in the imperative ('command') form.


Paragraphs

    ﻿Use paragraphs to show your reader the logic of the text.
    Each paragraph must have only one topic.
    Always start the paragraph with the topic sentence.
    The maximum length of a paragraph is 6 sentences. Do not use one-sentence paragraphs more than once in every 10 paragraphs.

I need to collect all information about log, log entries, and log data to the single place. Also using the John's newsletter.
